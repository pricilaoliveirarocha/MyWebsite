# I Need to Speak

I can understand English perfectly â€” I can **read, listen, and follow conversations** without problems.  
Yet, when it comes to speaking, I often feel **stuck**. Words donâ€™t come out as smoothly as they should, and I find myself hesitating, even when I know exactly what I want to say.

This can be frustrating at times, but I see it as a **challenge I can overcome**. Iâ€™m practicing speaking every day, building the **confidence and fluency** I need to communicate naturally.

I know that with **patience, persistence, and consistent practice**, I will reach a point where speaking English feels as effortless as understanding it.  
For me, itâ€™s not just about language â€” itâ€™s about **unlocking opportunities and connecting with the world**.
